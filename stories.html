	<h2>Deluged with endearments to deluged with tears...</h2>
	<p>Shashi was blessed with geniality. She was a very jovial girl.<br> People would surround her, the moment she was found free.<br>
	She would make every-being happy, within moments.<br> Being an active participant in every field, she was the top-picked<br> student in the school. 
	Everything happened in a sequel and<br> she prepared so very well for the exams that the upshot<br> of her whole efforts, was that, she was the topper of the school. 
	<br>Days later, she joined one of the top colleges. It was then that<br> she started communicating with her friends through social media.<br>
	There was this guy, named Karthik, with whom she hardly spoke<br> during school days; he is now a very intimate friend of hers.<br> The relationship they shared started with friendship.<br>
	They grew so close to each other that the time and talk had no bounds.<br>
	He was very bewitched by her. Shashi beguiled him with her heart,<br> with her comely face, with her thoughts and with every asset that she held.</p>
	<br><p>Karthik and Shashi were in different cities. It was almost two years and<br>
	they decided to meet. Both were onto  making this meet a remarkable one,<br> for they were both all set, to manifest the signs of concern for each other,<br>
	to  evince their love.<br>Shashi was even more excited to see him. Also, she was in a state of utter confusion.<br> Confusion drenched her mind, drowning her in many questions.<br> 
	Her expressions went from confusion to excitement to back again.<br> The whole of her mind was occupied with the thoughts to satisfy him. <br>
	She couldn’t even make out the best outfit for her, from her closet.<br> After a quite good while, she picked up the finest clothes from her wardrobe,<br> 
	which  portrayed her subtle and elegant looks.<br> She was incomparable with any beauty found, as she redefined the beauty itself. <br>
	She made sure twice before she stepped out, that she'd taken the present to be presented to him. <br>
	As she stepped out of her house, her voluminous, jet-black hair met the morning light and the lustrous curls bounced as she walked. 
	Her almond-eyes had its lashes and brows perfectly brushed.<br> Her bow-like lips were so appealing. She was ravishingly alluring.<br> 
	In no time, she drove to Hyderabad Social and was waiting for him.
	</p><br>
	<p>Karthik was equally excited to meet Shashi and he bought the <br>prettiest gift for her along with a bunch of red-roses. <br>
	He stepped out of his house being in a totally different world.<br> In the complete world of thoughts about Shashi.<br> Thoughts about how to please Shashi.<br>
	Just when he was thinking about this, he heard a harsh shrill, the screech of  the vehicle. <br>People hurriedly gathered around. Karthik didn’t know what was happening.<br>
	He was not in a situation to  move even his fingers.<br> He lay unconscious. Karthik felt extreme physical pain.<br> He then opened his eyes and saw a  huge crowd all around.<br>
	Before he could even understand the scenario, a pool of blood flowed all across his body.<br>
	He  felt the urge to contact Shashi. To tell her that he had set out to meet her.<br> To tell that he was bringing the thing that  she likes the most.<br>
	To tell how much he loves her. <br>And finally, to apologize, for he was leaving her behind.<br> Karthik  was now completely still. His heart stopped throbbing. <br>
	He was neither inhaling nor was he exhaling.<br> Every part in  his body was at rest.<br> He was at rest. <br>And he was to rest in peace.</p><br>
	<p>Shashi tried calling Karthik but to her surprise, there was no response.<br> It was the nineteenth call and there she was,  almost shouting without even the hello-starts.<br>
	Police attended her call this time and narrated the whole of the  incident.<br> She was totally baffled after what she heard.<br> She couldn’t even breathe.<br>
	She was completely broken into  pieces.<br> Shashi somehow gathered a little courage and in a blink, she moved to the parking-lot.<br>
	Her hazel eyes were  completely filled with tears.<br> Her heart was crying. Her mind was crying. Her soul was crying. <br>The complete she,  was crying.<br>
	With every broken piece of her heart, she was trying to convince herself<br> that this was the wildest  nightmare she had, but that was the bitter truth.<br>
	Days later, she went to his grave.<br> Shashi cried her heart out.<br> She  kept the gift, that she bought for him, on his grave and then said aloud,<br> “I love you, Karthik. Rest in peace.”</p>

	<h2>Just a Jest...</h2>
	<p>He was exhilarated. His heart pounded with eagerness, with excitement. <br>A spark lit his heart and mind and he bounced from his bed,<br>
	when he heard the knock at the door, the sound he had been<br> prophesying since morning. <br>After being delayed for three days from its original arrival date,<br>
	the package finally hit his abode. Hari thwacked his book down <br>onto the floor and rushed to the door. He opened up the front door of the place.<br>
	He couldn’t help but to let a large smile or rather the widest grin<br> appear on his face when he looked down to see the perfectly wrapped carton,<br>
	containing the beast he was waiting all along- OnePlus 5,<br> which he had ordered just a couple of days ago.<br>
	The delivery man drove off before Hari could even wave him a goodbye,<br>
	so he simply scrooched down, before he picked the small-sized box <br>up off the ground, cradling it like a newborn as he brought it inside.<br>
	Hari held it so carefully and tight, yet gentle, as if clasping someone.<br> Closing the door, he sat on the chair, comforting himself to comfort the new-born.<br>
	He quickly grabbed the cutter that was readily kept on the table in-front,<br> to unwrap the package. His hands trembled with excitement<br>
	as he got closer to seeing that his new phone was indeed a physical one<br> and he wasn’t just dreaming.</p><br>
	
	<p>When Hari was finally able to access the contents inside the bubble wrapped packaging, <br>
	he reached into the box and pulled out the actual OnePlus from the box and opened that up too.<br> It was just as beautiful as he had imagined it being,<br>
	and handled it with utmost care so that<br> he would not smudge the screen with his dirty fingerprints.<br>
	And now, he was all the way ready to turn the phone on and explore it to the fullest.<br>
	The screen lit up for a second, and it took a moment for it to go to its actual screen<br> on the display window where he needs to get it get started.<br>
	Upon finishing every step, Hari finally was there-accessing all the applications.<br> The very first thing that hit his mind was to get clicked.<br>
	So, ecstatically, he opened the camera app and got started.<br>
	It was at that instant that Hari noticed something freakish about the camera<br>
	that made his brows reach his hairline.<br>
	Hari tilted his head and examined it closely,<br> trying to scrutinize the thing that had caught his attention.<br>
	There were evidently, already clicked pictures on his supposedly “new” phone, <br>which he was wondering if it was simply repackaged. <br>
	Being the curious person that he is,<br> and due to the fact that he was now pissed over the fact that somehow<br>
	he had ended up with a used phone instead of the new one he had originally ordered,<br>
	Hari went to scroll through them.<br>
	When he did, he nearly dropped it,<br> his breath caught in the throat when he realized what he was seeing.<br>
	Chills ran down his spine and goosebumps formed<br> all along his arms, hands as he went over the photos.<br>
	The sight of them made his skin crawl.<br>
	He slowly gulped his drops of saliva down the throat. It was hard. Very difficult.<br> But somehow, gathered all his courage to view other snaps.<br>
	The pictures on his camera were the pictures of his very own house,<br>
	and more alarmingly, they were shot at night, from the woods in his backyard.<br> Hari couldn’t tell which one freaked him out the most - the one of him sleeping,<br>
	clicked from just beside his bed or<br>
	the one of him looking directly at the lens, sitting in the living room.</p>
